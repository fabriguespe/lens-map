## Social Media ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
Web2 networks all read from their unique, centralized database. There is no portability. Your profile, friends, and content are locked to a specific network and owned by the network operator. This causes each network to fight a zero-sum game for your attention.
<br><br> Lens Protocol corrects this by being a user-owned, open social graph that any application can plug into. Since users own their data, they can bring it to any application built on top of Lens Protocol. As the true owners of their content, creators no longer need to worry about losing their content, audience, and livelihood based on the whims of an individual platform's algorithms and policies. Additionally, each application using Lens Protocol benefits the whole ecosystem, turning the zero-sum game into a collaborative one. Developers can design meaningful social experiences without having to turn to feedback mechanisms to lock in a user's attention.

**[re:meme](https://www.rememe.lol)**<br />On-chain meme generator, built on top of Lens Protocol<br /><br /><br />
## Creator monetization ü§ë
Mirrors, collects, follows and comments allow creators to monetize their content directly to the user, without intermediaries and in a permissionaless way. Because creators own their content via the Lens Protocol, they can allow their followers to purchase that content.
<br />
<br />**[AaveFeeCollectModule](https://github.com/lens-protocol/modules/blob/master/contracts/collect/AaveFeeCollectModule.sol)**<br />Extend the LimitedFeeCollectModule to deposit all received fees into the Aave Polygon Market (if applicable for the asset) and send the resulting aTokens to the beneficiary.<br /><br /><br />
**[AuctionCollectModule](https://github.com/lens-protocol/modules/blob/master/contracts/collect/AuctionCollectModule.sol)**<br />This module works by creating an English auction for the underlying publication. After the auction ends, only the auction winner is allowed to collect the publication.<br /><br /><br />
**[DegreesOfSeparationReferenceModule](https://github.com/lens-protocol/modules/blob/master/contracts/reference/DegreesOfSeparationReferenceModule.sol)**<br />This reference module allows to set a degree of separation¬†n
, and then allows to comment/mirror only to profiles that are at most at¬†n
¬†degrees of separation from the author of the root publication.<br /><br /><br />
**[TeaParty](https://app.teaparty.life/)**<br />TeaParty empower creators to reach a larger audience and boost discoverability, while rewarding people for engaging with meaningful content<br /><br /><br />

**[UpdatableOwnableFeeCollectModule](https://github.com/lens-protocol/modules/blob/master/contracts/collect/UpdatableOwnableFeeCollectModule.sol)**<br />A fee collect module that, for each publication that uses it, mints an ERC-721 ownership-NFT to its author. Whoever owns the ownership-NFT has the rights to update the parameters required to do a successful collect operation over its underlying publication.<br /><br /><br />
## Curation üßπ
Curators amplify creator content by expanding its distribution reach. Curation involves gathering, elevating, and commenting on content for specific audiences. Curation is its own unique form of creation, and demands unique tools to do it.

## Bridges üåâ
Because we don't own neither our content nor our social graph we are lock into web2 networks. This adds a lot of friction when we try to bring people into web3 social. To start challenging these big network effects we need to have tools that make the transition easier.
<br />
<br />**[InLens](https://inlens.xyz/)**<br />Find your friends from Twitter in Lens Protocol. Create shareable lists.<br /><br /><br />

## Developer Tooling üë®üèº‚Äçüíª
Lens Protocol can be thought as a full fledge backend infrastructure that includes scalability, smart contracts, database, and authentication you can embed on your applications. Still, there are many areas in which certain tools, libraries, and integrations can help other developers built better applications.

**[Use lens](https://github.com/use-lens/use-lens)**<br />undefined<br /><br /><br />
## Identity üé≠
Every profile has an owner and with that, we are building up an on-chain identity for these profiles. This allows you to do powerful things like knowing if that profile has a human behind it, showing the ens name, and a lot more.
<br />
<br />**[Cultivator](https://cultivator.cc)**<br />Visual Explorer of the Lens Protocol Social Graph<br /><br /><br />
**[MashMesh](https://social.mashmesh.knn3.xyz/)**<br />Explore all the information about your social graph through a dynamic mesh. Get info about all NFT‚Äôs, POAP‚Äôs, Tokens, Votes, Events, Follows and collects.<br /><br /><br />

**[Verify Me!](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/verify-me-gcmnb)**<br />VerifyMe! democratizes the verification check mark on social media via POAP‚Äôs on Lens<br /><br /><br />
## Music üé∂
The Lens social graph has the power to revolutionize the music experience for both fans and artists. Fans will have new ways to discover music, find like-minded fans, and experience music together. Artists will have new ways to deepen their fan connection, and new options for commercializing their creations.
<br />
<br />**[Beets](https://wavwrld.com)**<br />Building infrastructure to enable unique musical experiences that connect artist with their true fans<br /><br /><br />
**[ClubSpace](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/clubspace-cwzqx)**<br />ClubSpace is a live listening party for creators to share their curated music NFTs with their Lens frens<br /><br /><br />

<br />
<br />**[Welook](https://welook.io/)**<br />Create your own POAPs, and share them with the world. Discover new wallets and POAPs.<br /><br /><br />
## Algorithms üßÆ
One challenge that every social application faces is how to moderate content and prevent spam in a censorship-resistant way. We know that if left unmoderated, spam and bots can ruin the experience and the trust and safety of the users.
<br />
<br />**[LensScore](https://devpost.com/software/lensscore-for-defi-lending-and-web3-interactions)**<br />LensScore is a protocol to calculate users' score based on metrics from Lens profiles and provide it to all EVM-compatible chains using RedStone Oracle.<br /><br /><br />
**[Meetvers](https://app.meetvers.io/)**<br />Find lens friends with similar Web3 footprint<br /><br /><br />
## DAO Tools üó≥
DAOs embody the promise of decentralized ownership and distributed operations. DAOs manage votes, decisions and assets, bypassing traditional legal set-ups. As DAOs continue to evolve, they will need help to improve how they assemble, organize, communicate and operate.
<br><br> Follow NFTs include built-in governance mechanisms. When following a profile, followers obtain a FollowNFT, which is the core building block of the Lens Protocol social graph. From a technical perspective, these NFTs contain governance-specific logic that allows any profile can spin up a DAO in minutes.
<br />
<br />**[Jokedao](https://www.jokedao.io/)**<br />Bottom-up, on-chain governance.
for user-generated roadmaps, grants, endorsements, bounties, curation, and community-driven decisions‚Äîincluding joke contests.<br /><br /><br />
