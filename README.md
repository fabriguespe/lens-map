## Identity üé≠
Every profile has an owner and with that, we are building up an on-chain identity for these profiles. This allows you to do powerful things like knowing if that profile has a human behind it, showing the ens name, and a lot more.

## Developer Tooling üë®üèº‚Äçüíª
Lens Protocol can be thought as a full fledge backend infrastructure that includes scalability, smart contracts, database, and authentication you can embed on your applications. Still, there are many areas in which certain tools, libraries, and integrations can help other developers built better applications.

## Algorithms üßÆ
One challenge that every social application faces is how to moderate content and prevent spam in a censorship-resistant way. We know that if left unmoderated, spam and bots can ruin the experience and the trust and safety of the users.

## Social Media ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
Web2 networks all read from their unique, centralized database. There is no portability. Your profile, friends, and content are locked to a specific network and owned by the network operator. This causes each network to fight a zero-sum game for your attention. Lens Protocol corrects this by being a user-owned, open social graph that any application can plug into. Since users own their data, they can bring it to any application built on top of Lens Protocol. As the true owners of their content, creators no longer need to worry about losing their content, audience, and livelihood based on the whims of an individual platform's algorithms and policies. Additionally, each application using Lens Protocol benefits the whole ecosystem, turning the zero-sum game into a collaborative one. Developers can design meaningful social experiences without having to turn to feedback mechanisms to lock in a user's attention.

## DAO Tools üó≥
DAOs embody the promise of decentralized ownership and distributed operations. DAOs manage votes, decisions and assets, bypassing traditional legal set-ups. As DAOs continue to evolve, they will need help to improve how they assemble, organize, communicate and operate. Follow NFTs include built-in governance mechanisms. When following a profile, followers obtain a FollowNFT, which is the core building block of the Lens Protocol social graph. From a technical perspective, these NFTs contain governance-specific logic that allows any profile can spin up a DAO in minutes.

## Events
IRL and remote events are embedded into our social experience. Tickets are now NFT's that can be transfer or re-sold in open markets. We also have Proof Attendance via POAP's and a like that become our memories and our identity.

## Curation üßπ
Curators amplify creator content by expanding its distribution reach. Curation involves gathering, elevating, and commenting on content for specific audiences. Curation is its own unique form of creation, and demands unique tools to do it.

## Bridges üåâ
Because we don't own neither our content nor our social graph we are lock into web2 networks. This adds a lot of friction when we try to bring people into web3 social. To start challenging these big network effects we need to have tools that make the transition easier.
